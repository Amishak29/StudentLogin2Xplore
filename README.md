# Student Enrollment System

## About the Project

The **Student Enrollment System** is a web-based application designed to manage student records. It allows users to input essential student information, including Roll Number, Full Name, Class, Birth Date, Address, and Enrollment Date. The system stores this data in the **STUDENT-TABLE** relation within the **SCHOOL-DB** database.

This project is implemented as a web form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It communicates with a backend database to save, retrieve, and manage student records in JsonPowerDB of Login2Xplore. It serves as an excellent example of web development and database integration.
